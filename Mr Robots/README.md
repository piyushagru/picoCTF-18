An easy web problem.
As the name and hint imply, you should look at the robots.txt file for this site.
This file (robots.txt) tells crawlers (such as google's) to not index the pages in it.
Accessing the file will show you:
##### User-agent: *
##### Disallow: /143ce.html

And now accessing /143ce.html:
##### So much depends upon a red flag
##### picoCTF{th3_w0rld_1s_4_danger0us_pl4c3_******_*****}

That's it!
